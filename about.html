            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Utkarsha Tamgire, a third-year Bachelor of Engineering student specializing in Information Technology. I'm pursuing my degree from Sant Gadge Baba  University, where I have developed a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and network systems.

                I have experience working with Java, JavaScript, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and React. Additionally, I am familiar with database management and mobile network systems.
                
                I have developed several projects, including a BMI calculator, a quiz app, and a portfolio website. These projects helped me strengthen my coding abilities and apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.
                
                I'm passionate about solving problems through technology and aspire to work in software development. Iâ€™m particularly interested in building scalable web applications and exploring AI-driven solutions.
                
                In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in technology.</p>
